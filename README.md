# PAD_LABS
This laboratory work comprises a microservice based system for storing ingredients and generating recipes. 

## System Architecture

![Local Image](images/SysArchitecture.drawio.png)

#### Load balancer: 
Entry point to the system, distributes incoming traffic across microservices. Ensures High Availability and Load 
Distribution.

#### API Gateway
Manages and routes requests to the appropriate microservices. Provides single entry point for client, enforces 
request handling.

#### Caching
Store frequently accessed data, reduce the need to fetch data from the database.

#### Logging
Records events and activites, helps track and diagnose issues, analyze system behaviour.

#### Ingredient Microservice
Responsible for managing ingredient related data. It connects to database to store and retrieve information about 
ingredients.

#### Recipe Microservice
Manages recipe-related data and interacts with its own database. Handles recipe creation, retrieval, updates.

#### Service Discovery
Provides dynamic service registration and discovery. Allows microservices to find and communicate with each other.

### Docker Images
In order to test the application, run the compose file from the PAD_LABORATORIES directory, using the commands:
```cmd
docker compose pull
```
```cmd
docker compose up
```

### NOTE: 
At this point in the implementation, the ingredient database must be created manually. 

Go to: *pad_laboratories-db-1* image

Write the command: *psql -U postgres*

Write the command: *create database ingredients;*

I will later write the script for this database to be created automatically.


The application is listening on port 5000. The Postman collection also contains calls on port 8001, specifically the 
Service Discovery port. You can use this endpoint to check the health of the Service Discovery. 

Please NOTE that there are multiple modifications to be made to the implementation, this is only the starting point.
